# Dynamic Task Execution System

## Overview

The Dynamic Task Execution System is a revolutionary approach to voice command automation that breaks down complex tasks into atomic, sequential operations. This system solves the "Can't get text" errors and provides reliable, step-by-step task execution.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. **Atomic Operations**
- Each task is broken down into single, atomic operations
- No more monolithic scripts that fail halfway through
- Better error recovery and debugging

### 2. **Sequential Execution**
- Tasks execute step-by-step with proper delays
- Real-time progress feedback in both main window and overlay
- Ability to continue or stop on errors

### 3. **Web Task Specialization**
- Dedicated handlers for YouTube, Google Search, and web navigation
- Pre-built step templates for common web actions
- Clipboard-based text input (fixes "Can't get text" errors)

### 4. **Smart Task Analysis**
- AI-powered task breakdown into logical steps
- Context-aware script generation
- Fallback mechanisms for complex requests

### Core Components

1. **TaskOrchestrator** (`task-orchestrator.js`)
   - Main coordinator for complex tasks
   - Breaks down commands into executable steps
   - Handles sequential execution with error recovery

2. **AtomicScriptGenerator** (`atomic-script-generator.js`)
   - Generates single-purpose AppleScripts
   - Provides predefined scripts for common actions
   - Handles proper text input using clipboard method

3. **Enhanced Main Process** (`main.js`)
   - Integrates new execution system
   - Provides multiple execution pathways
   - Real-time progress events

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Simple Actions
```javascript
// Voice: "open safari"
// Result: Single atomic script execution
```

### Complex Web Tasks
```javascript
// Voice: "play porcupine tree songs on youtube"
// Result: 
// 1. Open Safari
// 2. Navigate to youtube.com  
// 3. Find search field
// 4. Type "porcupine tree songs"
// 5. Execute search
// 6. Click first video
```

### System Commands
```javascript
// Voice: "take screenshot"
// Result: Instant screenshot using predefined script
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Fixing "Can't get text" Errors

The old approach that failed:
```applescript
tell application "System Events"
    type text "google.com"  # This causes the error
end tell
```

The new working approach:
```applescript
set the clipboard to "google.com"
tell application "System Events"
    keystroke "v" using command down
end tell
```

### Step Execution Flow

1. **Command Receipt**: Voice command processed
2. **Task Analysis**: AI breaks down into steps
3. **Step Generation**: Atomic scripts created
4. **Sequential Execution**: Steps run with delays
5. **Progress Feedback**: Real-time updates
6. **Error Handling**: Continue or stop on failure

## 📋 Predefined Actions

The system includes optimized scripts for:

- **Browser Control**: Safari, Chrome, Firefox
- **System Actions**: Screenshots, volume, lock screen
- **App Launching**: Finder, Notes, Mail, etc.
- **Navigation**: Keyboard shortcuts, text input
- **Web Browsing**: URL navigation, search, clicking

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite to validate the system:

```bash
yarn test-dynamic
```

This will verify:
- ✅ Atomic script generation
- ✅ Web browsing templates  
- ✅ Task breakdown analysis
- ✅ System status tracking

## 🎮 User Experience

### Main Window Feedback
```
🚀 Processing command: "play music on youtube"
🤖 Analyzing task and breaking into steps...
📋 Step 1/6: Open Safari browser
📋 Step 2/6: Focus address bar
📋 Step 3/6: Type URL: youtube.com
📋 Step 4/6: Navigate to URL
📋 Step 5/6: Search for: music
📋 Step 6/6: Click first video
🎉 Task completed successfully!
```

### Overlay Widget Progress
```
📋 Step 3/6: Type URL: youtube.com
```

## 🔄 Execution Pathways

The system intelligently chooses execution paths:

1. **Simple Actions** → Predefined scripts (instant)
2. **Web Tasks** → Template-based steps (fast)
3. **Complex Tasks** → AI-analyzed breakdown (comprehensive)

## 🛠️ Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_deepgram_key_here
```
